# Card Game Demo

Card Game Demo is a bare bones example of things that go into a digital card game.

  - Randomizer for card packs
  - RNG for in game events
  - Card Class to keep track of current card stats, damage, etc.
  - Game Class
  - User Class

### Card Collection  

Card Collection Section needs a RNG to determine the frequency at which cards show up in packs dependent on rarity and total number of cards in collection.
  - Probability of card showing up is different for each rarity
  - Probabiliy of cards of the same rarity dependent on how many cards of the same rarity there are.
  - Cards should have a minimum rarity requirement (at least 1 higher rarity card)
